TACO is a continuously growing image dataset of waste in the wild. It contains images of litter taken under
diverse environments: woods, roads and beaches. These images are manually labeled and segmented
according to an hierarchical taxonomy to train and evaluate object detection algorithms.

For convenience, annotations are provided in the COCO format.
TACO is still relatively small, but it is growing. Stay tuned!
